STARLANE & MySQL
Starlane does not require MySQL to run, however, if you wish to run applications within Starlane that require MySQL such as Wordpress then you will need to install a MySQL cluster on your Kubernetes instance.

MySQL OPERATOR

Starlane uses Oracle's MySQL Kubernetes Operator to provision and manage MySQL Clusters.

The install process in this directory is based on the instructions from this guide:
https://github.com/mysql/mysql-operator

Some resources have been renamed to make better sense in the Starlane.
